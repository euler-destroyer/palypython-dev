# The Paly Python Story

Paly Python is a school club for teaching students how to code through languages like Python and JS. In addition, it is a place to practice, engage with the programming community, and compete in fun events and activities. 

We launched the club last year and it was quite successful, with about 10 - 20 attendees each meeting. We carried that momentum into the summer and hosted 2 summer camps on Python and JS respectively for middle schoolers and high schoolers. The camp was a hit and we had 30+ students attend each summer camp. They all were very engaged and gave us some great [feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahOpTLc3BfcQx8LSOhRkM5KqA4fd7ekbzHaiq0ct7QA/edit?usp=sharing)! 

We also created a [video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxOoRzkw4U&list=PLi_--UjmM4GrOf2pKJWWjy2aY5m7fa-Jt) on Python which covers all of the basics to advanced topics like classes. This is part of an effort to expand our online resources so we can better teach this club year. For the past few weeks, we have been finalizing our new website and are proud to announce that it is ready to launch. 

Finally, we have some very exciting plans and a vibrant community ready for this year. Our discord server has around 60 members and many of them are eager to attend our school club meetings. In addition, we plan to keep on improving our resource library so club members can learn independently through the website. The club meetings can then be used for fun activities and events and community building such as helping each other out and working together.
