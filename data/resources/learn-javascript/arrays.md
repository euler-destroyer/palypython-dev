The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

## Syntax
Use the following syntax to create an Array object −

```
const fruits = [ "apple", "orange", "mango"]
```


The Array parameter is a list of strings or integers. When you specify a single numeric parameter with the Array constructor, you specify the initial length of the array. The maximum length allowed for an array is 4,294,967,295.

You can create array by simply assigning values as follows −

You will use ordinal numbers to access and to set values inside an array as follows.

```
fruits[0] is the first element //apple
fruits[1] is the second element //orange
fruits[2] is the third element  //mango
```
