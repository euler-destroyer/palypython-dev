The 'for' loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following three important parts −
- The loop initialization where we initialize our counter to a starting value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.
- The test statement which will test if a given condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed, otherwise the control will come out of the loop.
- The iteration statement where you can increase or decrease your counter.

You can put all the three parts in a single line separated by semicolons.

## Syntax
The syntax of for loop is JavaScript is as follows −

```
for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement) {
   Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
}
```
