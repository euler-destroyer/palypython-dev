Basic output
All languages need some way to output a result back. In javascript, this is console.log().
The message inside the parentheses will get printed to the console. Try running the following code, and then checking the console.

```
console.log("hello world")
```

This is the classic hello world exercise in programming. Note the use of parentheses around the message. This denotes a string, or a message, and not a piece of code to be executed. 

EXERCISE: Try changing the string and see what happens when you run it.
