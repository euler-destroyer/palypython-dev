#Data Structures

In this lesson of Learn Python, you will get an introduction to useing data structures like lists and dictionaries. 

You can convert between different types like numbers and strings using functions like int(), str(), or float(). 

Lists are just an ordered list of different things which can each be accessed using their index. Lists also have different functions associated with them like .append(). There are also other structures like dictionaries (lists with indexes you can specify), tuples (lists you canâ€™t change), and sets (lists without indices). See a list example below.

```
List = [1,2,3]
```

Round an input down (apply floor function).

Round an input up (apply ceiling function).
