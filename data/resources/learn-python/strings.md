#Strings
String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:

```
print("Hello")
print('Hello')
```

## Assign String to a Variable
Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

```
a = "Hello"
print(a)
```
## Multiline Strings
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

You can use three double quotes:

```
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
```
Or three single quotes:

```
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)
```
In this lesson of Learn Python, you will learn how to use Strings. 

Strings are simply an array of characters. They can be treated like arrays but also have their own special functions. See an example of getting a character from a string below.

```
x=x[0:4]
```
