Hi, I'm Jerry Xia, the Vice President of Paly Python, and I have been coding for 5 years now. I first got into programming when I was 8 years old at a beginner's Python class. Since then, I have learned some C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React.js for web development, and also SQL for databases.

Besides programming, I also like to speedcube, or solve the rubix cube as fast as possible. I'm also interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and I like to trade Bitcoin in my free time.
